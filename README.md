# VR-GemHunt-EscapeRoom
 

**Project Overview**

This project is a VR-based escape game developed using Unity. The player must navigate a virtual room, locate three hidden gems, and place them on a designated box. Once all three gems are placed, a door will open, allowing the player to escape the room. The game is controlled using the keyboard (WASD keys), without the need for physical VR controllers.

**• Keyboard Controls:** Player can move around the room and interact with objects using standard keyboard controls.
    • WASD for movement.
    • LSHIFT to grab objects with the right hand.

**• Gem Collection:** Three gems are hidden in the room. Players must find and place all gems on the box.
